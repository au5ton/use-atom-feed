[React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and custom parser for reading [Atom feeds](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html).


Included is a custom Atom feed parser: [`Parser.ts`](src/Parser.ts). If you just need to parse a feed directly, this could be useful to you. Within `test/` are some sample feeds that are used for test cases.

The models for this project are adapted from the Atom standard and from the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html).

This project is bootstrapped by [TSDX](https://github.com/formium/tsdx).
